# Use an official Node image as a base
# Choose a version compatible with SvelteKit and bun
FROM node:20-slim

# Install bun globally
# We use npm here just to install bun itself easily
RUN npm install -g bun

# Set the working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy package.json and bun.lockb (if it exists)
# This allows caching the dependency installation layer
COPY package.json bun.lockb* ./

# Install dependencies using bun
# Use --frozen-lockfile in CI/production builds for reproducibility
# For dev, a simple install is usually fine
RUN bun install

# This is done after bun install to leverage Docker cache

# Command to run the SvelteKit development server
# Use --host to make it accessible outside the container
